A WordPress plugin that displays weather warnings and today's weather forecast for a user-specified location using the WeatherAPI service.

Overview

The WeatherAPI Weather plugin integrates with the WeatherAPI (https://www.weatherapi.com) to fetch and display weather alerts and daily forecasts on your WordPress site. It supports customizable locations (e.g., "Stornoway" for the Isle of Lewis) and includes caching to optimize API calls, making it efficient even on the free tier (1 million calls/month). The plugin uses a shortcode [weather_forecast] to embed weather data in pages, posts, or widgets.
Features

Fetch weather alerts and today's forecast (temperature, weather condition, wind, precipitation probability).
Configurable via an admin settings page for API key and location.
Caches data (3 hours for forecasts, 1 hour for alerts, 12-hour fallback) to minimize API usage.
Responsive design with basic styling included.

Requirements

WordPress 6.0 or higher.
PHP 7.4 or higher.
A WeatherAPI key (free tier available at https://www.weatherapi.com).
